## Installation steps
### Prerequisites
Before starting, you should make sure the appropriate version of python is installed in your device. The version this project is based on is *Python 3.10*. To check which version you have you can run 
```
python --version
```
If the version in the output is _NOT_ 3.10, you should download it using this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/
### Setting up the environment 
After cloning the repository, run
```
python -m venv venv 
```
to create a virtual environment, then run
```
venv/scripts/activate
```
to activate the environment.

### Installing the requirements
To install all dependencies, run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If any new dependencies are added later in the project, just run the command above again.
